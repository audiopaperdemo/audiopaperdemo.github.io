00:00.805 --> 00:01.626
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.

00:02.546 --> 00:04.007
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's play another game.

00:04.848 --> 00:06.549
[SPEAKER_00]: This time you are guessing.

00:07.470 --> 00:09.031
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thinking about an animal.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the animal usually swim in water?

00:15.316 --> 00:17.678
[SPEAKER_00]: Please start asking me questions.

00:18.899 --> 00:20.980
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the animal live in water?

00:25.243 --> 00:27.385
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not reside in water.

00:28.388 --> 00:31.369
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're not fishing for clues in the wrong pond.

00:32.569 --> 00:34.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your animal fly?

00:36.050 --> 00:37.210
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiftly checking.

00:38.911 --> 00:40.351
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not fly.

00:41.692 --> 00:45.073
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like your guesses are having a bit of turbulence.

00:45.913 --> 00:49.534
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your animal usually reside in Europe?

00:51.194 --> 00:53.255
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I need to think a bit.

00:53.975 --> 00:55.676
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it can reside in Europe.

00:56.436 --> 00:56.796
[SPEAKER_00]: Eureka.

00:57.802 --> 00:59.943
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat closer to the truth you are.

01:02.245 --> 01:05.146
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal usually kept as a pet?

01:07.148 --> 01:07.908
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is usually kept as a pet.

01:14.932 --> 01:16.593
[SPEAKER_00]: You're barking up the right weight.

01:16.773 --> 01:18.514
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not supposed to say that.

01:19.115 --> 01:20.896
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep fetching those questions.

01:22.777 --> 01:26.119
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal carnivorous?

01:32.557 --> 01:33.818
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to say something.

01:34.499 --> 01:35.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal carnivorous?

01:39.884 --> 01:41.345
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is carnivorous.

01:42.386 --> 01:45.069
[SPEAKER_00]: Salivating at the rate scent I see.

01:48.152 --> 01:52.536
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your animal... Is your... Swiftly checking.

01:56.265 --> 01:59.286
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have missed a part of your question there.

01:59.666 --> 02:00.166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.687
[SPEAKER_00]: That was certainly a mysterious attempt.

02:06.147 --> 02:07.928
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal a type of cat?

02:13.589 --> 02:15.609
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is not a type of cat.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.070
[SPEAKER_00]: You're barking up the wrong tree with that guess.

02:19.990 --> 02:22.351
[SPEAKER_00]: Try a different category, perhaps.

02:23.751 --> 02:25.416
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal a type of dog?

02:27.864 --> 02:30.050
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is a dog you guessed correctly.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.200
[SPEAKER_00]: This concludes this round of the game.
