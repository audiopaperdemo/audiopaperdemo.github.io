1
00:00:00,851 --> 00:00:01,371
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

2
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:03,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play another game.

3
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:04,813
[SPEAKER_01]: This time you are guessing.

4
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:07,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thinking about an animal.

5
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:09,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have four legs?

6
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Please start asking me questions.

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have four legs?

8
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,123
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have four legs.

9
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:24,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep on your toes.

10
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:26,825
[SPEAKER_01]: You might just stumble on the answer.

11
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:29,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

12
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:33,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have more than four legs?

13
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:34,478
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have four legs.

14
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:39,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like you took a tiny misstep there, don't trip over your own questions.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,001
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to say something?

16
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have more than four legs?

17
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,923
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have more than four legs.

18
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:58,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not crawling with possibilities, are we?

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a reptile?

20
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,001
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to say something.

21
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:11,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a reptile?

22
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:14,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a second.

23
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:17,865
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not a reptile.

24
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:21,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it live in the water?

25
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:27,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not slithering towards the answer this time.

26
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:33,969
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to say something?

27
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it live in the water?

28
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Engaging deeper thought.

29
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it resides in the water.

30
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,812
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not floundering anymore.

31
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep swimming for the answer.

32
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a type of fish?

33
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're asking if it's a fish.

34
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:58,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Cast a wider net, but you're swimming in the right school now.

35
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it larger than a cat?

36
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:13,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

37
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is larger than a cat.

38
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like you're not fishing for compliments, just bigger fish.

39
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you consider this animal dangerous?

40
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:31,368
[SPEAKER_01]: In a jiffy.

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is considered dangerous.

42
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:38,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful now, don't bite off more than you can chew with your guesses.

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it extra dangerous for surfers?

44
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:47,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

45
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is particularly risky for those who surf.

46
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:56,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely riding the wave to success now.

47
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have very many teeth?

48
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,227
[SPEAKER_01]: in a jiffy.

49
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,676
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked him questions and have to guess.

50
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a shark?

51
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:14,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is a shark.

52
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:15,710
[SPEAKER_01]: You guessed correctly.

53
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,316
[SPEAKER_01]: This concludes this round of the game.
