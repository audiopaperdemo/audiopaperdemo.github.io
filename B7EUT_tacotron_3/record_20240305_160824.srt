1
00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

2
00:00:02,386 --> 00:00:04,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play another game.

3
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,529
[SPEAKER_01]: This time you are guessing.

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:09,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thinking about an animal.

5
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:13,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal larger than a human?

6
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:21,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is larger than a human.

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,201
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sizing me up to quickly, are you?

8
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:29,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the animal live on land?

9
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:31,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

10
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:39,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does reside on land.

11
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:43,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely towering over the competition with that guess.

12
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:49,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second.

13
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a domesticated animal?

14
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:58,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does reside on land.

15
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:01,476
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not beating around the bush, are you?

16
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:02,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.

17
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it domesticated?

18
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,259
[SPEAKER_00]: A domestic animal?

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

20
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not a domestic animal.

21
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:18,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like someone's barking up the wrong family tree.

22
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:23,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a carnivore?

23
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick scan.

24
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,116
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not a carnivore.

25
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:34,319
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to sharpen those claws of thought.

26
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:41,284
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to say something.

27
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:43,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lot heavier than a human?

28
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:46,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second.

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is significantly heavier than a human.

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,581
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not lightweight in your questioning.

31
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:00,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an elephant?

32
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:02,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

33
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,183
[SPEAKER_01]: No, your guess is not correct.

34
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep trunkting along with those questions.

35
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick scan.

36
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:22,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal dangerous to humans?

37
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not considered dangerous to humans.

38
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:34,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, you won't need any armor for this one.

39
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:44,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the animal have any patterns on itself?

40
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflecting on that.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,355
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked 10 questions and have to guess.

42
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,539
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the animal, a giraffe.

43
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sorry you guessed wrong.

44
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,193
[SPEAKER_01]: This concludes this round of the game.
