That was fun.
Let's play another game.
This time you are guessing.
I am thinking about an animal.
Is the animal larger than a human?
Yes, it is larger than a human.
You're not sizing me up to quickly, are you?
Does the animal live on land?
Let's see.
Yes, it does reside on land.
Absolutely towering over the competition with that guess.
Just a second.
Is it a domesticated animal?
Yes, it does reside on land.
You're not beating around the bush, are you?
Good job.
Is it domesticated?
A domestic animal?
Hold on.
No, it is not a domestic animal.
Looks like someone's barking up the wrong family tree.
Is it a carnivore?
Quick scan.
No, not a carnivore.
You might want to sharpen those claws of thought.
You have to say something.
Is it a lot heavier than a human?
Just a second.
Yes, it is significantly heavier than a human.
You're definitely not lightweight in your questioning.
Is it an elephant?
Hold on.
No, your guess is not correct.
Keep trunkting along with those questions.
Quick scan.
Is the animal dangerous to humans?
No, it's not considered dangerous to humans.
Don't worry, you won't need any armor for this one.
Does the animal have any patterns on itself?
Reflecting on that.
You have asked 10 questions and have to guess.
It's the animal, a giraffe.
I am sorry you guessed wrong.
This concludes this round of the game.
