Hi there, let's play 10 questions.
Is the animal you're thinking of typically kept as a pet?
Yes.
Ah, fantastic.
That certainly narrows it down.
Is the animal you're thinking of small enough to be held in your arms?
Of course, yes.
A wonderful that narrows it down quite a bit.
Is this animal a type of rodent?
I'm not quite sure.
Okay, then back to the drawing board it seems.
Does this animal have fur?
Yes.
Ah, splendid.
That narrows it down.
Does this animal have fur?
Yes!
Ah, that's great.
Seems like I'm getting closer.
Is it known for its ability to purr?
Can you repeat that again?
Is it known for its ability to purr?
To purr?
What does that mean?
I'm gonna skip this.
Is the animal primarily a carnivore known for eating meat?
No, I don't think so.
Uh, no?
Alright, I need to consider other options.
I mean, yes, but not raw meat.
Is it a type of bird?
No.
Well, if I thought I was out to do something interesting, let's see, what else could it be?
Does this animal commonly reside indoors?
Yes, both, but more or less indoors, yeah.
Okay, I'm getting warmer with this.
Is this animal prone to climbing or jumping onto elevated surfaces like furniture?
It depends on what species.
Some yes, some no.
I have asked my questions and have failed to guess correctly.
This concludes this round of the game.
I'll try again next time.
