00:00.871 --> 00:01.692
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

00:02.432 --> 00:03.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play another game.

00:04.553 --> 00:06.134
[SPEAKER_01]: This time you are guessing.

00:06.915 --> 00:08.436
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thinking about an animal.

00:11.218 --> 00:13.459
[SPEAKER_01]: Please start asking me questions.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.320
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it able to swim?

00:21.024 --> 00:23.005
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not known for swimming.

00:23.926 --> 00:27.928
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd throw you a life jacket, but we're on dry land with this one.

00:29.645 --> 00:30.525
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a carnivore?

00:32.266 --> 00:32.926
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

00:35.647 --> 00:37.147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is a carnivore.

00:37.828 --> 00:38.808
[SPEAKER_01]: Chomp chomp.

00:39.568 --> 00:41.909
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some sharp teeth on that one.

00:43.529 --> 00:44.450
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have scales?

00:46.250 --> 00:47.331
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second.

00:51.872 --> 00:53.573
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have scales.

00:54.453 --> 00:57.974
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like you're fishing for clues in the wrong pond.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.191
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a canine?

01:03.072 --> 01:03.712
[SPEAKER_01]: In a jiffy?

01:05.374 --> 01:07.055
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not a canine.

01:07.875 --> 01:10.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe try howling up a different tree.

01:11.658 --> 01:12.859
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it part of the... Let's see.

01:14.060 --> 01:15.321
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it part of the cat family?

01:22.506 --> 01:24.887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is part of the cat family.

01:25.708 --> 01:28.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect, you're clawing your way to the top.

01:31.195 --> 01:33.196
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it known to reside in a jungle?

01:35.116 --> 01:36.377
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflecting on that.

01:38.677 --> 01:41.938
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not typically associated with the jungle.

01:42.759 --> 01:46.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like the king of the jungle moniker doesn't apply here.

01:48.501 --> 01:49.161
[SPEAKER_01]: In a jiffy.

01:51.121 --> 01:53.402
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't reside in the jungle.

01:54.282 --> 01:58.944
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like you're not quite the king of this particular guessing jungle yet.

02:00.151 --> 02:01.331
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it live in the savannah?

02:03.052 --> 02:05.312
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I need to think a bit.

02:09.053 --> 02:11.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does reside in the savannah.

02:12.073 --> 02:13.053
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot, hot, hot.

02:13.853 --> 02:16.774
[SPEAKER_01]: Your instincts are on a safari to success.

02:18.414 --> 02:19.414
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a mane?

02:21.115 --> 02:21.715
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

02:24.975 --> 02:26.496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does have a mane.

02:27.276 --> 02:28.176
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking sharp.

02:29.013 --> 02:31.616
[SPEAKER_01]: You're nearly the king of this guessing game.

02:33.037 --> 02:34.899
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lion?

02:37.942 --> 02:40.725
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked 10 questions and have to guess.

02:42.166 --> 02:42.847
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lion?

02:45.149 --> 02:46.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is a lion.

02:46.471 --> 02:47.792
[SPEAKER_01]: You guessed correctly.
