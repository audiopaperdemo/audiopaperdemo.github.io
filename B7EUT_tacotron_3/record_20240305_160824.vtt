00:00.785 --> 00:01.566
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

00:02.386 --> 00:04.007
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play another game.

00:04.808 --> 00:06.529
[SPEAKER_01]: This time you are guessing.

00:07.469 --> 00:09.070
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thinking about an animal.

00:11.752 --> 00:13.974
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal larger than a human?

00:19.697 --> 00:21.859
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is larger than a human.

00:22.699 --> 00:25.201
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sizing me up to quickly, are you?

00:28.143 --> 00:29.524
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the animal live on land?

00:31.167 --> 00:31.707
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

00:36.948 --> 00:39.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does reside on land.

00:40.269 --> 00:43.550
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely towering over the competition with that guess.

00:48.531 --> 00:49.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.672
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a domesticated animal?

00:56.072 --> 00:58.193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does reside on land.

00:59.215 --> 01:01.476
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not beating around the bush, are you?

01:02.097 --> 01:02.677
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.

01:04.378 --> 01:06.039
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it domesticated?

01:06.299 --> 01:07.259
[SPEAKER_00]: A domestic animal?

01:08.760 --> 01:09.300
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

01:11.481 --> 01:13.703
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not a domestic animal.

01:14.803 --> 01:18.125
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like someone's barking up the wrong family tree.

01:22.227 --> 01:23.848
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a carnivore?

01:25.369 --> 01:26.009
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick scan.

01:28.835 --> 01:30.116
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not a carnivore.

01:31.477 --> 01:34.319
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to sharpen those claws of thought.

01:40.123 --> 01:41.284
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to say something.

01:41.304 --> 01:43.705
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lot heavier than a human?

01:45.286 --> 01:46.207
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.512
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is significantly heavier than a human.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.581
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not lightweight in your questioning.

01:58.781 --> 02:00.121
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an elephant?

02:01.702 --> 02:02.202
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

02:04.982 --> 02:07.183
[SPEAKER_01]: No, your guess is not correct.

02:08.063 --> 02:10.623
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep trunkting along with those questions.

02:15.164 --> 02:15.885
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick scan.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.186
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal dangerous to humans?

02:27.472 --> 02:30.533
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not considered dangerous to humans.

02:31.553 --> 02:34.394
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, you won't need any armor for this one.

02:39.916 --> 02:44.797
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the animal have any patterns on itself?

02:46.458 --> 02:47.618
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflecting on that.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.355
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked 10 questions and have to guess.

03:03.076 --> 03:04.539
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the animal, a giraffe.

03:06.923 --> 03:08.867
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sorry you guessed wrong.

03:09.909 --> 03:12.193
[SPEAKER_01]: This concludes this round of the game.
