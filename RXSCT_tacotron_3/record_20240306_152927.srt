1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:01,626
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.

2
00:00:02,546 --> 00:00:04,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's play another game.

3
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:06,549
[SPEAKER_00]: This time you are guessing.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thinking about an animal.

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:13,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the animal usually swim in water?

6
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Please start asking me questions.

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the animal live in water?

8
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:27,385
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not reside in water.

9
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:31,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're not fishing for clues in the wrong pond.

10
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:34,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your animal fly?

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiftly checking.

12
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,351
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not fly.

13
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:45,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like your guesses are having a bit of turbulence.

14
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your animal usually reside in Europe?

15
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:53,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I need to think a bit.

16
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it can reside in Europe.

17
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:56,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Eureka.

18
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:59,943
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat closer to the truth you are.

19
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:05,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal usually kept as a pet?

20
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:07,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is usually kept as a pet.

22
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:16,593
[SPEAKER_00]: You're barking up the right weight.

23
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not supposed to say that.

24
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:20,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep fetching those questions.

25
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:26,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal carnivorous?

26
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:33,818
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to say something.

27
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:35,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal carnivorous?

28
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:41,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is carnivorous.

29
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:45,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Salivating at the rate scent I see.

30
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:52,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your animal... Is your... Swiftly checking.

31
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:59,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have missed a part of your question there.

32
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

33
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,687
[SPEAKER_00]: That was certainly a mysterious attempt.

34
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:07,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal a type of cat?

35
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,609
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is not a type of cat.

36
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,070
[SPEAKER_00]: You're barking up the wrong tree with that guess.

37
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Try a different category, perhaps.

38
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:25,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your animal a type of dog?

39
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:30,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is a dog you guessed correctly.

40
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,200
[SPEAKER_00]: This concludes this round of the game.
