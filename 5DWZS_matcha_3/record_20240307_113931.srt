1
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:01,692
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play another game.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,134
[SPEAKER_01]: This time you are guessing.

4
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:08,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thinking about an animal.

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:13,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Please start asking me questions.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it able to swim?

7
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:23,005
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not known for swimming.

8
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:27,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd throw you a life jacket, but we're on dry land with this one.

9
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:30,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a carnivore?

10
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:32,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

11
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:37,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is a carnivore.

12
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:38,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Chomp chomp.

13
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:41,909
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some sharp teeth on that one.

14
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:44,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have scales?

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second.

16
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:53,573
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have scales.

17
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:57,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like you're fishing for clues in the wrong pond.

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a canine?

19
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:03,712
[SPEAKER_01]: In a jiffy?

20
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:07,055
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not a canine.

21
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe try howling up a different tree.

22
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:12,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it part of the... Let's see.

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it part of the cat family?

24
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:24,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is part of the cat family.

25
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect, you're clawing your way to the top.

26
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:33,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it known to reside in a jungle?

27
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflecting on that.

28
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:41,938
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not typically associated with the jungle.

29
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like the king of the jungle moniker doesn't apply here.

30
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,161
[SPEAKER_01]: In a jiffy.

31
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,402
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't reside in the jungle.

32
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:58,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like you're not quite the king of this particular guessing jungle yet.

33
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it live in the savannah?

34
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I need to think a bit.

35
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does reside in the savannah.

36
00:02:12,073 --> 00:02:13,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot, hot, hot.

37
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Your instincts are on a safari to success.

38
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:19,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a mane?

39
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:21,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

40
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does have a mane.

41
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking sharp.

42
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:31,616
[SPEAKER_01]: You're nearly the king of this guessing game.

43
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:34,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lion?

44
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:40,725
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked 10 questions and have to guess.

45
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:42,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a lion?

46
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is a lion.

47
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,792
[SPEAKER_01]: You guessed correctly.
