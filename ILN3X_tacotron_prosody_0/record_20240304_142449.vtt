00:00.694 --> 00:02.315
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, let's play 10 questions.

00:06.096 --> 00:08.798
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal you're thinking of typically kept as a pet?

00:09.638 --> 00:09.858
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

00:12.359 --> 00:13.119
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, fantastic.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.820
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly narrows it down.

00:22.584 --> 00:25.825
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal you're thinking of small enough to be held in your arms?

00:27.406 --> 00:27.906
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, yes.

00:30.069 --> 00:31.991
[SPEAKER_00]: A wonderful that narrows it down quite a bit.

00:36.615 --> 00:38.336
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this animal a type of rodent?

00:40.878 --> 00:41.739
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure.

00:41.759 --> 00:46.063
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then back to the drawing board it seems.

00:49.486 --> 00:50.627
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this animal have fur?

00:51.548 --> 00:51.748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

00:54.210 --> 00:54.830
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, splendid.

00:56.712 --> 00:57.573
[SPEAKER_00]: That narrows it down.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.549
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this animal have fur?

01:03.630 --> 01:03.850
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes!

01:06.192 --> 01:06.792
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's great.

01:07.413 --> 01:08.614
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like I'm getting closer.

01:14.759 --> 01:16.520
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it known for its ability to purr?

01:20.444 --> 01:21.444
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you repeat that again?

01:23.626 --> 01:25.888
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it known for its ability to purr?

01:26.769 --> 01:27.449
[SPEAKER_00]: To purr?

01:27.469 --> 01:28.430
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?

01:30.100 --> 01:30.960
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna skip this.

01:31.921 --> 01:35.342
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal primarily a carnivore known for eating meat?

01:35.982 --> 01:37.502
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.

01:39.843 --> 01:40.283
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no?

01:40.923 --> 01:43.084
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I need to consider other options.

01:43.724 --> 01:45.645
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, but not raw meat.

01:48.186 --> 01:49.286
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a type of bird?

01:50.907 --> 01:51.307
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:51.327 --> 01:57.869
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I thought I was out to do something interesting, let's see, what else could it be?

02:02.540 --> 02:04.862
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this animal commonly reside indoors?

02:05.402 --> 02:11.286
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, both, but more or less indoors, yeah.

02:11.546 --> 02:12.667
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm getting warmer with this.

02:17.610 --> 02:22.113
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this animal prone to climbing or jumping onto elevated surfaces like furniture?

02:24.815 --> 02:27.196
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what species.

02:31.573 --> 02:33.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Some yes, some no.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.010
[SPEAKER_00]: I have asked my questions and have failed to guess correctly.

02:43.851 --> 02:45.934
[SPEAKER_00]: This concludes this round of the game.

02:46.715 --> 02:48.097
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try again next time.
