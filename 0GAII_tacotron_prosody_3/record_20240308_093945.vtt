00:00.851 --> 00:01.371
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

00:02.092 --> 00:03.032
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play another game.

00:03.733 --> 00:04.813
[SPEAKER_01]: This time you are guessing.

00:05.754 --> 00:07.134
[SPEAKER_01]: I am thinking about an animal.

00:08.655 --> 00:09.976
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have four legs?

00:11.537 --> 00:13.117
[SPEAKER_01]: Please start asking me questions.

00:15.879 --> 00:17.180
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have four legs?

00:21.822 --> 00:23.123
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have four legs.

00:24.103 --> 00:24.844
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep on your toes.

00:24.884 --> 00:26.825
[SPEAKER_01]: You might just stumble on the answer.

00:28.926 --> 00:29.026
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

00:31.897 --> 00:33.577
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have more than four legs?

00:33.597 --> 00:34.478
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have four legs.

00:35.698 --> 00:39.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like you took a tiny misstep there, don't trip over your own questions.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.001
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to say something?

00:46.741 --> 00:48.621
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have more than four legs?

00:53.102 --> 00:54.923
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it does not have more than four legs.

00:56.163 --> 00:58.944
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not crawling with possibilities, are we?

01:03.740 --> 01:05.001
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a reptile?

01:05.101 --> 01:06.001
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to say something.

01:10.623 --> 01:11.603
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a reptile?

01:13.224 --> 01:14.144
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a second.

01:16.605 --> 01:17.865
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not a reptile.

01:19.706 --> 01:21.047
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it live in the water?

01:23.608 --> 01:27.009
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not slithering towards the answer this time.

01:33.069 --> 01:33.969
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to say something?

01:34.349 --> 01:35.790
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it live in the water?

01:37.370 --> 01:39.071
[SPEAKER_01]: Engaging deeper thought.

01:40.071 --> 01:41.411
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it resides in the water.

01:42.312 --> 01:43.812
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not floundering anymore.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep swimming for the answer.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.513
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a type of fish?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're asking if it's a fish.

01:55.195 --> 01:58.096
[SPEAKER_01]: Cast a wider net, but you're swimming in the right school now.

02:08.692 --> 02:10.714
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it larger than a cat?

02:12.535 --> 02:13.075
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

02:15.517 --> 02:17.158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is larger than a cat.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.021
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like you're not fishing for compliments, just bigger fish.

02:26.805 --> 02:29.047
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you consider this animal dangerous?

02:30.788 --> 02:31.368
[SPEAKER_01]: In a jiffy.

02:33.390 --> 02:34.811
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is considered dangerous.

02:35.836 --> 02:38.418
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful now, don't bite off more than you can chew with your guesses.

02:41.940 --> 02:44.701
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it extra dangerous for surfers?

02:46.823 --> 02:47.463
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

02:51.545 --> 02:53.707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is particularly risky for those who surf.

02:54.547 --> 02:56.589
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely riding the wave to success now.

03:02.092 --> 03:03.733
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have very many teeth?

03:05.666 --> 03:06.227
[SPEAKER_01]: in a jiffy.

03:07.871 --> 03:09.676
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked him questions and have to guess.

03:10.678 --> 03:11.500
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a shark?

03:13.906 --> 03:14.928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is a shark.

03:14.948 --> 03:15.710
[SPEAKER_01]: You guessed correctly.

03:16.612 --> 03:18.316
[SPEAKER_01]: This concludes this round of the game.
