That was fun.
Let's play another game.
This time you are guessing.
I am thinking about an animal.
Does the animal usually swim in water?
Please start asking me questions.
Does the animal live in water?
No, it does not reside in water.
Hope you're not fishing for clues in the wrong pond.
Does your animal fly?
Swiftly checking.
No, it does not fly.
Seems like your guesses are having a bit of turbulence.
Does your animal usually reside in Europe?
Excuse me, I need to think a bit.
Yes, it can reside in Europe.
Eureka.
somewhat closer to the truth you are.
Is your animal usually kept as a pet?
Let me see.
Yes, it is usually kept as a pet.
You're barking up the right weight.
I'm not supposed to say that.
Keep fetching those questions.
Is your animal carnivorous?
You have to say something.
Is your animal carnivorous?
Yes, it is carnivorous.
Salivating at the rate scent I see.
Does your animal... Is your... Swiftly checking.
I think you might have missed a part of your question there.
Yes, I did.
That was certainly a mysterious attempt.
Is your animal a type of cat?
No, it is not a type of cat.
You're barking up the wrong tree with that guess.
Try a different category, perhaps.
Is your animal a type of dog?
Yes, it is a dog you guessed correctly.
This concludes this round of the game.
