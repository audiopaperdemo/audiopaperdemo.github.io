00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:02,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, let's play 10 questions.

2
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:08,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal you're thinking of typically kept as a pet?

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:09,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, fantastic.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,820
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly narrows it down.

6
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:25,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal you're thinking of small enough to be held in your arms?

7
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:27,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, yes.

8
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,991
[SPEAKER_00]: A wonderful that narrows it down quite a bit.

9
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this animal a type of rodent?

10
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:41,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure.

11
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then back to the drawing board it seems.

12
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this animal have fur?

13
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:51,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, splendid.

15
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:57,573
[SPEAKER_00]: That narrows it down.

16
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this animal have fur?

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:03,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes!

18
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:06,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's great.

19
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:08,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like I'm getting closer.

20
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it known for its ability to purr?

21
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:21,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you repeat that again?

22
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it known for its ability to purr?

23
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:27,449
[SPEAKER_00]: To purr?

24
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:28,430
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna skip this.

26
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:35,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the animal primarily a carnivore known for eating meat?

27
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:37,502
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.

28
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:40,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no?

29
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:43,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I need to consider other options.

30
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:45,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, but not raw meat.

31
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:49,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a type of bird?

32
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:51,307
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

33
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:57,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I thought I was out to do something interesting, let's see, what else could it be?

34
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this animal commonly reside indoors?

35
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:11,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, both, but more or less indoors, yeah.

36
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:12,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm getting warmer with this.

37
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this animal prone to climbing or jumping onto elevated surfaces like furniture?

38
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,196
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what species.

39
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Some yes, some no.

40
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I have asked my questions and have failed to guess correctly.

41
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,934
[SPEAKER_00]: This concludes this round of the game.

42
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try again next time.
